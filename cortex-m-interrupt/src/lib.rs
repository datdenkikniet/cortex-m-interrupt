/// Return an instance of an unnameable struct that implements [`NvicInterruptRegistration`], which
/// is bound to the interrupt specified by `interrupt` with logical priority `priority`.
///
/// `interrupt` must name an enum variant of an enum that implements [`InterruptNumber`] with _at least_ 2 path segments.
///
/// For instance, `Interrupt::EXTI15_10` (where `Interrupt` implements [`InterruptNumber`]) is allowed,
/// but `EXTI15_10` by itself, even if imported using `use Interrupt::EXTI15_10`, is not.
///
/// The returned struct has the following features:
/// * Calling `register` more than once for the same `Interrupt` panics.
/// * The bound interrupt will be masked in the NVIC before configuring the occupation of the registration, and
/// unmasked after.
/// * The the amount of available NVIC priority bits is determined runtime.
///
/// # Logical priority
///
/// A logical priority with a lower value has a lower priority level. This means that the logical priority
/// `1` has the lowest priority level, while logical priority `2^N` (where `N = <available priority bits on platform>`)
/// has the highest priority level. A logical priority of `0` is not allowed, and a logical priority greater than `2^N` panics
/// at runtime.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use cortex_m_interrupt::take_nvic_interrupt;
///
/// // The value returned by `take_nvic_interrupt` will
/// // always `impl cortex_m_interrupt::NvicInterruptRegistration`.
/// let registration = take_nvic_interrupt!(interrupt, priority);
///
/// ```
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// // For example, using stm32f1xx hal:
/// use stm32f1xx_hal::pac::interrupt;
/// let registration = cortex_m_interrupt::take_nvic_interrupt!(interrupt::EXTI15_10, 7);
/// ```

/// Return an instance of an unnameable struct that implements [`ExceptionRegistration`], which
/// is bound to the exception specified by `exception`.
///
/// `exception` may be any of the variants of [`Exception`] (from [`cortex_m`]), except
/// for [`Exception::HardFault`]
///
/// The returned struct has the following features:
/// * Calling `register` more than once for the same [`Exception`] panics.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use cortex_m_interrupt::take_exception;
///
/// // The value returned by `take_exception` will
/// // always `impl cortex_m_interrupt::ExceptionRegistration`.
/// let registration = take_exception!(exception);
/// ```
///

/// // For example:
/// let registration = cortex_m_interrupt::take_exception!(SysTick);
