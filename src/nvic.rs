/// Determine the amount of priority bits available on the current MCU.
///
/// This function determines the amount of priority bits available on a Cortex-M MCU by
/// setting the priority of an interrupt to the maximum value `0xFF`, and reading the resulting
/// priority.
///
/// The count of leading ones in the resulting value indicates the amount of
/// priority-level bits available.
///
/// After performing this calculation, the priority of the placeholder interrupt is **not** restored.
///
/// It is guaranteed that all non-implemented priority bits will be read back as zero for any
/// NVIC implementation that conforms to the [GIC] (see section 3.5.1), which includes at least all
/// [armv7m] (see section B1.5.4) and [armv6m] (see section B3.4) cores.
///
/// # Safety
/// This function should only be called from a critical section, as it alters the priority
/// of an interrupt.
///
/// The caller must restore the priority of `placeholder_interrupt` to a known-and-valid priority after
/// calling this function, as [`determine_prio_bits`] does not restore the overwritten priority.
